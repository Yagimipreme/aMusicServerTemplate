aMusicServer 🎵A robust local automation suite designed to bridge the gap between cloud streaming and local high-fidelity libraries. aMusicServer synchronizes your SoundCloud likes and Spotify playlists directly to your machine, ensuring your library is offline-ready for high-performance use cases like DJing or archival.🚀 Quick Start (No Python Required)Designed for end-users. No environment configuration needed.Download: Grab the latest MusicServerLauncher.exe from the Releases page.Run: Place the executable in any directory and launch it.Setup: Follow the interactive CLI prompts to link your profiles.Enjoy: The launcher orchestrates all background drivers and dependencies automatically.[!TIP]Persistence: Your configuration is stored in %AppData%/Roaming/MusicServerTemp/. Updating the .exe will not delete your settings or history.🏗 System ArchitectureThe application utilizes a Manager-Worker pattern. A central launcher coordinates specialized Python sub-modules to handle network traffic, browser automation, and media encoding.1. Interactive ConfigurationUpon the first execution, windows_launcher.py initiates a setup wizard to map your cloud footprint to your local filesystem.<details><summary><b>For interested ppl (Technical Details: Config Mapping)</b></summary>The configuration is serialized into config.json. To maintain cross-platform compatibility during development while ensuring Windows stability, the launcher resolves all paths using pathlib.Path and os.path.abspath.Entry Points: The launcher uses subprocess.run with sys.executable to spawn child processes, ensuring the bundled Python interpreter is utilized across all sub-scripts.Path Sanitization: _ensure_dir() handles recursive directory creation and validates write permissions before the sync begins.</details>2. The Synchronization EngineThe core logic resides in script.py (SoundCloud) and app.py (Spotify/sTownload).SoundCloud Sync: Automates discovery of new likes.Spotify Sync (WIP): Parses public metadata for playlist reconstruction.Delta-Downloader: Only fetches tracks not present in the local song_dir.<details><summary><b>For interested ppl (Technical Details: Selenium & Traffic Analysis)</b></summary>Browser AutomationThe scraper utilizes Selenium WebDriver in headless mode.Traffic Interception: grab_client_id2() parses Chrome's performance logs to sniff the client_id directly from SoundCloud's API-v2 requests.Anti-Bot Measures: It utilizes uBlock Origin (via ublock.crx) to reduce DOM noise and AutomationControlled flags to mimic human interaction.Media PipelineAudio extraction bypasses standard lossy recording by targeting HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) playlists:Encoding: The source code calls an embedded FFmpeg binary.Bitstream Filtering: Uses -bsf:a aac_adtstoasc to ensure the resulting MP3/AAC container is correctly structured for metadata tagging via eyeD3.</details>3. Web-Extension Integration (WIP)Bridge the gap between active browsing and your local server.Platform: Chrome-based (Chrome, Brave, Edge). Firefox pending.Protocol: Communicates via a local HTTP POST request to a listener (see sWebExt/py-server/server.py).⚠️ Project Status: Work in ProgressThe sTownload module and Web-Extension are currently in Active Beta.Development focus: Handling SoundCloud's dynamic DOM updates and Spotify's OAuth flow.Contribution: Issues and PRs are welcome in the scripts/ directory.🛠 Developer & Source SetupTo run from source or contribute to the logic:RequirementsRequirementMinimum VersionNotePython3.10+Required for type-hinting supportFFmpegLatestMust be in System PATHChromeLatestRequired for Selenium WebDriverDependenciesBashpip install selenium yt-dlp eyeD3 ffmpeg-python webdriver-manager
<details><summary><b>For interested ppl (Technical Details: PyInstaller Bundling)</b></summary>The standalone binary is generated via windows_launcher.spec.Hidden Imports: Critical modules like yt_dlp and eyed3 are explicitly included in the Analysis block because they are called via exec() or subprocesses, making them invisible to PyInstaller’s static analysis.Resource Pathing: The resource_path() function handles the translation between the dev environment and the temporary _MEIxxxx folder used by the EXE at runtime.</details>📦 DeploymentTo compile your own version:Clone the repository.Ensure ffmpeg.exe and ublock.crx are in the root directory.Run the compiler:Bashpyinstaller --clean windows_launcher.spec
